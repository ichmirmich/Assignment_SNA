	abstract = {This project investigates political astroturﬁng, i.e. hidden propaganda by powerful political actors aimed at mimicking grassroots activity, on social media. We focus on Twitter accounts used by the South Korean secret service to inﬂuence the 2012 presidential elections in favor of the eventual winner, Park Geun-hye. Two independent cluster analyses based on activity patterns of the Twitter accounts and textual features of tweets reliably reveal that there are three groups of {NIS} accounts, including one group that engages mostly in retweeting, and another group focused on posting news articles with a link. We show that these groups reﬂect different strategic agendas and correspond to several secret service
agents identiﬁed in the court documents. We argue that these patterns of coordinated tweeting are consistent with predic-
tions derived from principal-agent theory, and should therefore appear in other astroturﬁng campaigns as well.},

heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known

detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying
language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web
graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also
verified on ad hoc modular networks.},
