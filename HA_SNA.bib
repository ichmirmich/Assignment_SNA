	abstract = {This project investigates political astroturﬁng, i.e. hidden propaganda by powerful political actors aimed at mimicking grassroots activity, on social media. We focus on Twitter accounts used by the South Korean secret service to inﬂuence the 2012 presidential elections in favor of the eventual winner, Park Geun-hye. Two independent cluster analyses based on activity patterns of the Twitter accounts and textual features of tweets reliably reveal that there are three groups of {NIS} accounts, including one group that engages mostly in retweeting, and another group focused on posting news articles with a link. We show that these groups reﬂect different strategic agendas and correspond to several secret service
agents identiﬁed in the court documents. We argue that these patterns of coordinated tweeting are consistent with predic-
tions derived from principal-agent theory, and should therefore appear in other astroturﬁng campaigns as well.},
